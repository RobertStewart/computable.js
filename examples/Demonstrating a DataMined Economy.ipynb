    "In this IPython notebook, we walk through construction of a DataMined economy. Recall the basic construction of DataMined: \"tokens\" are issued for addition of valid data to the network. Users who add data to the network are called \"miners.\" Miners are typically assumed to be consumers who'd like to contribute and safeguard their individual data, however they may be non-profits or businesses as well. Data contributed in to the network is stored on storage nodes within the network. For small datasets, miners can store data locally on their own machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that since miners are rewarded for contributing data to the network via token issuance, there is a strong incentive to attack the network by contributing fake data. Consequently, network security is critically dependent on `Validator`s which can detect fraudulent data. Another interesting aspect of network design is that direct download of data off the network can't be permitted due to excessive risk of data leakage. As a result, computation must be performed on the network itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"tokens\" used in this network are called `DataCoin`s. These tokens conform to the [ERC20](https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard) for tokens issued on the Ethereum network. For those new to ethereum development, the token is a form of currency whose fidelity is guaranteed by Ethereum network miners (note the distinction; ethereum miners are *not* necessarily DataMined data miners). Customers who wish to perform computation on data in the network must pay both miners and compute nodes in tokens to request that computation be performed on interesting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we introduce the core DataMined package `datamined` and demonstrate how to use `datamined` to construct an example data economy. Since this is an example economy, this code runs on a single local machine. In addition, tokens issued in this economy are run on a tiny, local instantiation of the Ethereum protocol. (The same code can be deployed onto larger Ethereum networks, but would take much longer to run to completion).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by defining the number of participants in our economy."
