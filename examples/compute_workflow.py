# Provides a simple example of how to perform computation with the datamined API. Data is stored using dm.data.Client objects. Them dm.compute.Node instances perform a basic computation upon the data from the corresponding nodes.

# Assumes that dm.data.Client objects have the ability to generate "ledger_access_key"s which provide access to the data stored at the ledger location.
# TODO(rbharath): What is the right cryptographic primitive to perform this? Obviously, using the private key would allow for this, but that's a non-starter. Is there some elliptic curve operation to create partial access keys that can (ideally) be revoked?
