# Provides an example of a dummy cryptoeconomy. This economy is created by a

# rewarded for their cryptoeconomic with coin issuances. Next, a number of
# compute nodes enter the economy. Note that compute nodes start with empty
# wallets. Sequentially, a number of buyers enter the market. Buyers select
# random users to interact with. If the user grants permission to the buyer,
# the buyer receives the ledger key, which it then uses to perform a
# computation.
